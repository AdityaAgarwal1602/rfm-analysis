# RFM Analysis Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using a real-world dataset.

## Workflow

1. **Dataset Source**: The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Online Retail dataset).
2. **Data Processing**: Data is cleaned and processed using SQL queries (see `processing_query.sql`).
3. **Dashboard**: The processed data is visualized and analyzed using an Excel dashboard (`Analysis Dashboard.pdf`).

## Files & Folders
- `Dataset/Online Retail.xlsx`: Raw dataset from UCI.
- `processing_query.sql`: SQL script for data cleaning and processing.
- `Processed Data.csv`: Output after processing.
- `RFM Analysis.xlsx`: Excel file for dashboard creation.
- `Analysis Dashboard.pdf`: Exported dashboard.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset from UCI and place it in the `Dataset` folder.
2. Run the SQL script to process and clean the data.
3. Use the processed data in Excel to create or view the dashboard.

## Credits
- Dataset: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
